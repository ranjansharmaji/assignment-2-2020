Q4

When the magnitude of the derivative increases but the solution magnitude does not. In this situation, the error can grow so large that it dominates the calculations.
Initial-value problems for which this is likely to occur are called stiff equations.


Electrical circuits with capecitor,resistence and inductor(LCR) or LR or RC circuits because Stiff differential equations are characterized as those whose exact solution has a term
of the form e^-ct.
